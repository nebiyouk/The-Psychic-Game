<h2>Guess what letter I'm thinking of</h2>
<p>Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.</p>
<p>and the will show you the result like : -</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)</li>
<li>Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)</li>
<li>Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)</li>
<li>Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses)</li>
<li>When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page)</li>
<li>When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins)</li>
</ul>
